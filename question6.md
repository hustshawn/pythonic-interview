Question 6
===
What does this code output:
```python
def f(x,l=[]):
    for i in range(x):
        l.append(i*i)
    print(l) 

f(2)
f(3,[3,2,1])
f(3)
```
### Answer
```
[0, 1]
[3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4]
[0, 1, 0, 1, 4]
```
## Hu?

The first function call should be fairly obvious, the loop appends 0 and then 1 to the empty list, l. l is a name for a variable that points to a list stored in memory. The second call starts off by creating a new list in a new block of memory. l then refers to this new list. It then appends 0, 1 and 4 to this new list. So that's great. The third function call is the weird one. It uses the original list stored in the original memory block. That is why it starts off with 0 and 1.

Try this out if you don't understand:
```python
l_mem = []

l = l_mem           # the first call
for i in range(2):
    l.append(i*i)

print(l)            # [0, 1]

l = [3,2,1]         # the second call
for i in range(3):
    l.append(i*i)

print(l)            # [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4]

l = l_mem           # the third call
for i in range(3):
    l.append(i*i)

print(l)            # [0, 1, 0, 1, 4]
```
