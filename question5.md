Question 5
===
How do you keep track of different versions of your code?

### Answer:

Version control! At this point, you should act excited and tell them how you even use `Git` (or whatever is your favorite) to keep track of correspondence with Granny. Git is my preferred version control system, but there are others, for example `subversion`.

## Why This Matters:

Because code without version control is like coffee without a cup. Sometimes we need to write once-off throw away scripts and that's ok, but if you are dealing with any significant amount of code, a version control system will be a benefit. Version Control helps with keeping track of who made what change to the code base; finding out when bugs were introduced to the code; keeping track of versions and releases of your software; distributing the source code amongst team members; deployment and certain automations. It allows you to roll your code back to before you broke it which is great on its own. Lots of stuff. It's just great.
