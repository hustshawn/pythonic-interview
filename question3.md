Question 3
===

Looking at the below code, write down the final values of A0, A1, ...An.
```python
A0 = dict(zip(('a','b','c','d','e'),(1,2,3,4,5)))
A1 = range(10)
A2 = sorted([i for i in A1 if i in A0])
A3 = sorted([A0[s] for s in A0])
A4 = [i for i in A1 if i in A3]
A5 = {i:i*i for i in A1}
A6 = [[i,i*i] for i in A1]
```
If you dont know what `zip` is don't stress out. No sane employer will expect you to memorize the standard library. Here is the output of` help(zip)`.
```
zip(...)
    zip(seq1 [, seq2 [...]]) -> [(seq1[0], seq2[0] ...), (...)]
    
    Return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the i-th element
    from each of the argument sequences.  The returned list is truncated
    in length to the length of the shortest argument sequence.
```
If that doesn't make sense then take a few minutes to figure it out however you choose to.

### Answer
```python
A0 = {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'e': 5, 'd': 4}  # the order may vary
A1 = range(0, 10) # or [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] in python 2
A2 = []
A3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
A4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
A5 = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}
A6 = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 4], [3, 9], [4, 16], [5, 25], [6, 36], [7, 49], [8, 64], [9, 81]]
```
## Why This Matters

List comprehension is a wonderful time saver and a big stumbling block for a lot of people
If you can read them, you can probably write them down
Some of this code was made to be deliberately weird. You may need to work with some weird people
