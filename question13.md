Question 13
===
Place the following functions below in order of their efficiency. They all take in a list of numbers between 0 and 1. The list can be quite long. An example input list would be [random.random() for i in range(100000)]. How would you prove that your answer is correct?

```python
def f1(lIn):
    l1 = sorted(lIn)
    l2 = [i for i in l1 if i<0.5]
    return [i*i for i in l2]

def f2(lIn):
    l1 = [i for i in lIn if i<0.5]
    l2 = sorted(l1)
    return [i*i for i in l2]

def f3(lIn):
    l1 = [i*i for i in lIn]
    l2 = sorted(l1)
    return [i for i in l1 if i<(0.5*0.5)]
```
### Answer

Most to least efficient: f2, f1, f3. To prove that this is the case, you would want to profile your code. Python has a lovely profiling package that should do the trick.
```python
import cProfile
lIn = [random.random() for i in range(100000)]
cProfile.run('f1(lIn)')
cProfile.run('f2(lIn)')
cProfile.run('f3(lIn)')
```
For completion's sake, here is what the above profile outputs:
```python
>>> cProfile.run('f1(lIn)')

## Why Care?

Locating and avoiding bottlenecks is often pretty worthwhile. A lot of coding for efficiency comes down to common sense - in the example above it's obviously quicker to sort a list if it's a smaller list, so if you have the choice of filtering before a sort it's often a good idea. The less obvious stuff can still be located through use of the proper tools. It's good to know about these tools.
