Question 15
===
Do you have any personal projects?

## Really?

This shows that you are willing to do more than the bare minimum in terms of keeping your skillset up to date. If you work on personal projects and code outside of the workplace then employers are more likely to see you as an asset that will grow. Even if they don't ask this question I find it's useful to broach the subject.

## Conclusion
These questions intentionally touched on many topics. And the answers were intentionally verbose. In a programming interview, you will need to demonstrate your understanding and if you can do it in a concise way then by all means do that. I tried to give enough information in the answers that you could glean some meaning from them even if you had never heard of some of these topics before. I hope you find this useful in your job hunt.
