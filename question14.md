Question 14
===
Something you failed at?

### Wrong answer

I never fail!

## Why This Is Important:

Shows that you are capable of admitting errors, taking responsibility for your mistakes, and learning from your mistakes. All of these things are pretty darn important if you are going to be useful. If you are actually perfect then too bad, you might need to get creative here.
